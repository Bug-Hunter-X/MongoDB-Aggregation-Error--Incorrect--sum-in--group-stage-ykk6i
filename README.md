# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Incorrect $sum in $group stage
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$group` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The error involves the incorrect usage of the `$sum` operator, leading to inaccurate aggregation results.

## Problem
The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline that attempts to group documents by a field (`fieldName`) and calculate the sum of another field (`anotherField`). However, the `$sum` operator is used incorrectly, resulting in an unexpected output.  The aggregation fails to produce accurate sums.

## Solution
The solution corrects the usage of the `$sum` operator within the `$group` stage. The corrected code ensures that the `$sum` operator correctly sums numerical values in the specified field. This ensures the accurate calculation of totals for the specified field across the grouped documents.
